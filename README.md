# SupportPulse 🚀  
*A modern, role-based customer support ticketing platform*

## 🌟 Vision
SupportPulse aims to simplify customer support for growing teams by providing a clean, role-based, and scalable ticketing system.

The goal is to build a platform where:
- Customers can easily raise and track issues

- Administrators have full visibility and control over the support workflow

SupportPulse is designed to start simple, stay intuitive, and grow into a powerful support ecosystem over time.

## 🎯 What Problem Are We Solving?

- Too complex for small teams  
- Too expensive to get started  
- Hard to customize or extend  

SupportPulse focuses on **clarity, usability, and extensibility**, making it easy to adopt while remaining future-ready.
